Twilio Instant Conference PHP
==========================

PHP based script that lets you SMS in, generates a pin number and returns the details of a conference room you can then distribute to colleges via SMS

One of the coolest things about having your own phone number with Twilio (Twilio.com). Is that you can do some very nifty things with it.

For example, if you need a conference room setup with a text message you can forward to your friends, you can configure this in a PHP script quite easily, we can even get the script to respond to your request with details about the number to ring and the pin code.

If you haven’t already done so, head over to Twilio (Twilio.com) an sign up. This will provision you a Twilio number that you can call into and interact with.

When the script responds, you can then copy and paste this SMS message into a group SMS or Whatsapp and allow people to call into the conference room.

This is a very simple conference line setup tool, and it will need some further modifying to make it secure. For example right now any 4 digit numbers will create a conference room. You may wish to modify the code so that only generated pin numbers can be used and those numbers cannot be reused – entirely up to you.
